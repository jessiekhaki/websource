<p>
Olatunji is a postdoctoral research associate and his research
interests lie in the interface of statistics and epidemiology. He is
particularly interested in developing geospatial statistical methods
to address various public health questions in the poorest populations
of the world. He is the author of
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SDALGCP/index.html">SDALGCP</a>,
an R package for analyzing spatially aggregated disease data.
</p>

<p>
Olatunji did his PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology at CHICAS Research
Group of the Lancaster Medical School under the supervision of
Prof. Peter Diggle, Dr Emanuele Giorgi and Prof. Jo Knight. He
formerly obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Master’s
degree in Mathematical Sciences from the Federal University of
Technology Akure, Nigeria and African Institute for Mathematical
Sciences, Tanzania, respectively.

<p>
His research focuses on the development of the statistical methodology
for disease risk mapping. Specifically, the development of novel
geostatistical methods for spatially aggregated data. He has developed
a geostatistical method to analyse river blindness data in Cameroon
and through this work,, he was able to identify communities that need
urgent treatment. In addition, he has developed a geostatistical
framework for analysing spatially aggregated health outcomes that are
environmentally driven. Furthermore, he has developed a
spatio-temporal for the prediction of COPD emergency hospitalisation
across North West England. He is currently working with the Neglected
Tropical Disease (NTD) modelling consortium on the development and
application of geospatial statistical methods for the design and
analysis of prevalence surveys when the disease in question is at or
close to elimination.
