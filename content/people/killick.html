  Rebecca sees their research as a feedback loop, being inspired by problems in real world applications, creating novel methodology to solve those problems and then feeding these back into the problem domain.  Their primary research interests lie in development of novel methodology for the analysis of univariate and multivariate nonstationary time series models. This covers many topics including developing models, model selection, efficient estimation, diagnostics, clustering and prediction. Rebecca is highly motivated by real world problems and has worked with data in a range of fields including Bioinformatics, Energy, Engineering, Environment, Finance, Health, Linguistics and Official Statistics.  Rebecca is passionate about ensuring the availability and accessibility of research in the form of open-source software.  As part of this they advocate to the statistical community the importance of recognition of research software as an academic output, are co-Editor in Chief of the Journal of Statistical Software and a member of the rOpenSci statistical software peer review board.
