I am a postgraduate student in the CHICAS Research Group of the
Lancaster Medical School and I am supervised by Dr. Christopher Jewell
and Professor Peter Neal.  For my Bachelor in Mathematics I have
studied in Bremen, Germany and Izmir, Turkey. Following a 6 months
internship in the industry, I formally obtained my Master of Science
degree in Biomathematics from the University of Greifswald, Germany.

My master thesis project was in cooperation with the Department of
Epidemiology of the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health in
Riems, Germany. The objective was to detect traders in the German pig
trade network through a self developed dynamic programming
algorithm. By means of the classification the aim was to then analyse
the network for significant changes following the outbreak of the
Classical Swine Fever in Germany in 2006.

For my PhD, I will be working on disease outbreak models combining an
algorithmic and spatio-temporal approach. The data I am working with
are from the Theileriosis disease outbreak of cattle in New Zealand.
