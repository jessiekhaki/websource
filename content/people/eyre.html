<p>
I am a Medical Research Council (MRC) Doctoral Training Partnership
(DTP) student (2017- 2021) studying the Epidemiology and Statistics
PhD with the CHICAS research group at Lancaster Medical School. The
DTP programme is a collaboration between the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and CHICAS. I am supervised by Professor
Peter Diggle, Dr Emanuele Giorgi and Professor Federico Costa
(Fiocruz/Federal University of Bahia, Brazil) and work between the UK
and Salvador, Brazil.
</p><p>
My research interests include spatial epidemiology, statistical
methodologies for epidemiology, urban health and disease control for
diseases of poverty.
</p><p>
My PhD research focusses on leptospirosis in vulnerable urban
communities in Salvador, Brazil and includes i) an analysis of
spatiotemporal determinants of infection and potential transmission
routes, ii) modelling Leptospira-specific antibody response in humans,
iii) multivariate geostatistical modelling to improve detection of
rodents for rodent-borne zoonoses; iv) evaluating the impact of local
government infrastructural interventions on severe leptospirosis
incidence.

I hold an MEng degree in Engineering from the University of Cambridge
and an MSc degree in the Control of Infectious Diseases from the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
