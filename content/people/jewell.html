<p>
Chris works at the interface between epidemiology, infectious disease
modelling, statistics, and high performance computing.  He originally
trained as a veterinary surgeon, but became interested in epidemics
through his experience working on the foot and mouth disease outbreak
in the UK in 2001.  He believes strongly in application-focused
statistical research and in effective communication of scientific
outputs.
</p>

<p>
As a trained vet, Chris' interests lie in decision support systems for
disease outbreak response, public health and zoonotic diseases.  He
has applications in communicable diseases such as foot and mouth
disease, vector-borne diseases such as theileriosis, and zoonoses such
as campylobacteriosis.  In computational statistics, he works on MCMC
methods for inference on stochastic dynamical models.  He has a
particular interest in high performance computing techniques for
applying modern statistical methods to real-time inference on large
population datasets.

Chris currently has collaborations with <a href="http://www.mpi.gov.nz">MPI</a>
and <a href="http://www.idrec.ac.nz">IDRec</a> in New Zealand, <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz">Massey
University</a>, the EPSRC programme grant
<a href="http://www.i-like.org.uk">I-Like</a>, and
<a href="http://www.fic.nih.gov">RAPIDD</a> in the US.

Outside work, Chris enjoys outdoor sports, especially rock climbing
and mountaineering, and plays the harpsichord and pipe organ.  He is
the proud owner of a 1971 MGB GT.
