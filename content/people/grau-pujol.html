<p>
I am a visitor phD student from Barcelona Institute for Global Health
(ISGlobal), Spain, and Centro de Investigação em Saúde da Manhiça,
Mozambique. I will be at CHICAS, Lancaster University, from March 2019
until June 2019 supervised by Dr Emanuele Giorgi. My PhD focuses on
the emergence of soil-transmitted helminths albendazole-resistance in
rural Southern Mozambique using a geostatistical approach.
