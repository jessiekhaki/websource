I am a PhD student in Statistics &amp; Epidemiology at the Centre for Health Informatics Computation and
Statistics (CHICAS, Lancaster University). I am supervised by Dr Luigi Sedda and Dr Rod Dillon. My PhD
will focus on mapping of vector borne diseases and co-occurrence of diseases and vectors. I hold a BSc
degree in Tropical Disease Biology and MSc in molecular biology of parasites and disease vectors from
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
