I am a second year PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the CHICAS research group at 
Lancaster University. My research focuses on modelling spatial point pattern process data with 
applications to diseases such as typhoid. My work, which is funded by the Commonwealth 
Scholarship Commission, is being supervised by Dr Emanuele Giorgi, Dr Chris Jewell, Dr Marc 
Henrion, Professor Mavuto Mukaka and Professor Melita Gordon.

Master of Biostatistics (Chancellor College, University of Malawi) and a Bachelor of 
Science in Statistics and Mathematics (Chancellor College).
