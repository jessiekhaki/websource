I am a second year PhD student in the CHICAS research group at Lancaster University. I am 
studying towards a PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology. My research focuses on modelling 
spatial point pattern process and geostatistical data. Some of my work is applied to 
infectious diseases such as typhoid. My studies are funded by the Commonwealth Scholarship
Commission.
