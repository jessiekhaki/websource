I am a second year PhD student in Statistics and Edepidemiology in the CHICAS research 
group at Lancaster University and my supervision team is led by Dr Emanuele Giorgi.
My research interests are in modelling spatial point pattern process and geostatistical 
data. I currently focus on applications to infectious diseases such as 
typhoid. My studies are funded by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission.

Previously, I earned a Master of Science in Statistics from Lancaster University. Before that,
I obtained a Master of Science in Biostatistics and Bachelor of Science in Statistics and 
Mathematics from Chancellor College, now the University of Malawi.
