I am a MRC Research Fellow working at the interface of biostatistics and informatics in CHICAS at the
Lancaster Medical School. My fellowship research has several strands which include:
<ul>
  <li>The Dynamic Health Altas - a web based application that I have
    developed to display point or areal data in space and time in
    real-time. More information and demonstrations are on the project
    page.
  </li>
  <li>Progression of Kidney disease: this research uses data collected
    from secondary care patients attending Salford Royal NHS Foundation
    Trust (UK) and investigates the key factors in the loss of kidney function in
    these patients.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 My research also involves developing statistical models and software
for real-time surveillance of routinely recorded diseases in the
veterinary sector. In addition, I am interested in developing
statistical models and software for estimating disease risk of a
population who are travelling around in a geographical region, tracked
by GPS; this is the moving/path analogue of a point processes.
