<p>

  I am a spatial epidemiologist funded by the Royal Society under the
  Newton International Fellowship scheme (2021-2023) and hosted by the
  CHICAS research group at Lancaster Medical School, Lancaster
  University. I work under the guidance of Dr Emanuele Giorgi to
  develop geostatistical methods for mapping prevalence in presence of
  incomplete spatial information using malaria school survey data from
  Kenya. I collaborate with Professor Bob Snow and Dr Emelda Okiro,
  both from KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya where I am
  a visiting researcher.

<p>
I am interested in the application of geospatial models to derive
spatial health metrics to aid in a better understanding of health
inequalities, vulnerabilities, and population health. Particularly the
use of conditional autoregressive models and model based geostatistics
to map disease prevalence, child health outcomes; characterizing
physical access, marginalization to healthcare and creation of health
indices.
</p>
<p>
I hold BSc and MSc degrees in Geomatic Engineering & Geospatial
Information Systems from JKUAT, Kenya, a post graduate diploma in
health research methods of Pwani University, Kenya and a PhD in
spatial epidemiology of The Open University, UK and KWTRP.
