<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
The Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics (CHICAS)
is a group of staff, research associates, and postgraduate students in
the Lancaster Medical School, part of the Faculty of Health and
Medicine at Lancaster University. You can see our list of
<a href="/people">current staff and students</a>.
</p>
<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p>
Our research focus is on statistical and epidemiological methods and
their implementation in open-source software. We have long-standing
expertise in longitudinal, spatial and spatio-temporal methods, and
growing expertise in infectious disease modelling, design of field
studies, statistical genetics and computationally efficient methods
for high-dimensional data.
</p>
<p>
Our current teaching focus is on postgraduate and CPD courses at the
intersection of statistics, epidemiology and health informatics.

</p>
<h2>Where do we apply this?</h2>
<p>
Our work has involved national and international partners, and has had impact
across the globe. We have a special interest in the epidemiology of disease
in developing countries. See our <a href="map.html">map</a> for more info.
</p>
<h2>Interesting Links</h2>
<p>
We have a set of <a href="spatialepi.html">external links</a> of interesting
spatial epidemiology applications and disease maps produced by other groups.
