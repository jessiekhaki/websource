<h2>Geospatial Statistics</h2>
<p>
The geospatial statistics theme covers the development of statistical
methodology motivated by and applied to problems in population health
research where the locations of health outcomes in geographical space
play an important role in their interpretation. The group works in
both developed and developing country settings, but has a global
health focus that is pursued through strong collaborative links with
low and middle income countries in Africa, South America and southern
Asia.
</p>

<h2>Population Health Data</h2>

<p>
Novel health datasets available to research communities such as
routinely collected data can be used to answer a wide range of
data-driven research questions that can directly benefit health
research and practice. Using these data, projects within the group
cover a range of areas including epidemiology, diagnostic accuracy and
health service improvement. We apply existing methods as well as
developing new ones with a number of clinical foci including
Neurology, Respiratory and Mental Health Services as well as Care
Homes. The group works with a diverse range of local and national
organisations such as the Office for Health Improvement and
Disparities (OHID), Office for National Statistics (ONS), the
Integrated Care System and Public Health services within the local
government. In addition we support local NHS data science projects and
groups.

<p>
Infectious diseases have health and economic impacts for both humans
and livestock. The CHICAS group works with partners in low-, middle-
and high-income countries to better understand the epidemiology of
infectious diseases, and how and where they transmit. We develop
statistical methodology and generate scientific insights to provide
timely information and understanding of epidemics to inform their
control and eradication. Our projects include a range of applications
(including SARS-CoV-2, influenza and foot-and-mouth) with national and
international academic and public/animal health partners including
Public Health England, the Department of Health and Social care, the
Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.
