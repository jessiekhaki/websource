<p>
The problem of combining prevalence data obtained using different
diagnostics is an important problem that often arises in disease
mapping and surveillance. We develop geostatistical models to combine
prevalence data arising from multiple diagnostics.  The focus of our
application is mapping Loa loa to identify high risk areas for
lymphatic filariasis an onchocerciasis treatment in Africa.
