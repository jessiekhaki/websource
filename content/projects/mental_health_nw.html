Mental illness is rising amongst children, young people and
adults. One in six school-aged children has a mental health problem,
and this is likely to have been made worse by the COVID-19
pandemic. Mental health services are struggling to meet this rising
demand for help, and patients must navigate a complex network of
services to receive care, which includes NHS, local
authorities and voluntary, community, faith, and social
enterprise groups. Long waiting times can lead to further decline in
mental health, affecting social outcomes and increasing the need for
urgent treatment. Working in partnership with Lancashire and South Cumbria
NHS Foundation Trust (LSCFT) we will map patients’ movements
through LSCFT services. We look at the capacity in different parts of
the system and patient flow between services, including close
investigation of inequalities in access and various
barriers. Working with people who design healthcare
services we will improve patient flow through the system and ensure
the mental health patients get the support they need.

  including PhD candidate student Hayley Lowther.
