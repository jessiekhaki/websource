<p>
Snakebite is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the world largely affecting
rural communities living in tropical and subtropical countries.
</p>
<p>
We are collaborating with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of
Kelaniya, Sri Lanka, to estimate the global burden of disease, develop national-level snakebite
risk models based on geo-referenced socio-demographic and ecological predictors and to validate
models against survey data from Kenya and Eswatini.
