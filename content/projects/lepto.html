<p>
In urban slum settings, leptospirosis is transmitted primarily through
contact with infected rat urine. We are collaborating with the
<a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/health-and-life-sciences/">University of Liverpool</a>,
the <a href="http://portal.fiocruz.br/en/content/home-ingl%C3%AAs">Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation</a> and
<a href="http://publichealth.yale.edu/">Yale University School of Public Health</a>
to study the patterns of human disease
and rat population dynamics in a slum community in the Brazilian city
of Salvador.
