<p>
Neurologists in the UK are a limited resource and waiting lists for appointments in
outpatient neurology services are frequently long. There is therefore a need to investigate
how to improve the service in terms of both efficiency and patient experience – getting the
right care to the right people in the right timeframe.
</p>
<p>
Large amounts of data are collected during a patient’s journey through the healthcare
system, and although this is not collected expressly for the purpose of research it represents
a rich resource of information that can be harnessed to answer questions about patient care
and experience.
</p>
<p>
This project seeks to use routinely collected data to understand neurology outpatient
services, and to investigate ways in which they could be improved. Approaches include:
<ul>
<li>An analysis of waiting times and frequency of testing, follow-up and discharge from a
  consultant led service.</li>
<li>
A proposal of a methodology for identifying unexpected numbers of referrals for
headache from GP surgeries.
</li>
<li>An investigation into the use of State Sequence Analysis to identify common
  pathways though outpatient services and classify patient subgroups.
</li>
</ul>
